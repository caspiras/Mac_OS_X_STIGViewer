- This project was done to satify the need for using the only DISA approved STIG Viewer. 
- Using Cursor AI, I was able to take the existing Windows and Linux STIG Viewers and recreate a .dmg file that is fully functional.  
- Fully functional meaning creating, importing, exporting, saving, etc. 
- The caveat, I did not sign the app since I am not the original creator of STIGViewer meaning OSX does will not scan it before the install.  However, after attempting to install the appliecation, go to System Settings, Privacy and Security and allowing the App to be installed.
