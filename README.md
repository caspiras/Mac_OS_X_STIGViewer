## MacOS STIGViewer 2.18

As it stands, DISA (https://cyber.mil) latest 2.X version of STIGViewer is not supported on OS X.  For a lot of us Mac users, this means finding other means or workarounds, such as installing a Virtual Machine (VM) to meet the DoD STIG requirements.  

## Why does this matter?

Example:
A couple years ago, DISA released newer versions of STIGs with updated Vulnerability Identification (V-ID) numbers and also a new version of STIGViewer.  

Without using that newer version of STIGViewer, the updated V-IDs could not be seen. 

Additionally, Security Content Automation Protocols (SCAPs) could not sucuessfully map to previous or legacy V-IDs without using the most up-to-date STIG Viewer. 

While this may be a small or minusucle example, having the most up-to-day STIGViewer is important for overall accuracy. 

## Solution

Using Cursor AI, the program was prompted to use the existing Linux and Windows OS new 2.18 versions, to recreate it for Mac OS X .dmg.


## Result

Fully functional meaning creating, importing, exporting, saving, etc. 

## Issues
Because I am not the orginator of STIGViewer, I was not comfortable signing it as an application that I created/made.  This does cause an error when trying to install the .dmg file. However, there is a simple fix or workaround.
